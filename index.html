<a name="craigs-project-page" class="anchor" href="#craigs-project-page"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Craig's Project Page</h2>

<p>Many of my projects are open source and hosted here on github. This page is an
overview of my work in Haskell.</p>

<h3>
<a name="mutate" class="anchor" href="#mutate"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>mutate</h3>

<p>My <a href="https://github.com/cdxr/haskell-mutate">mutate</a> package is an attempt to
formalize the relationships between various types of mutable variables such
as IORefs, STRefs, and TVars.</p>

<p>The original motivation of this library was to be able to write operators and
larger abstractions that would simply do what you expect with different kinds
of mutable variables.</p>

<p>This has proven more complicated than I originally anticipated. Types such as
IORef, STRef, TVar, and StateVar support similar operations but have subtle
semantic differences in regards to exceptions and concurrency. It is an ongoing
project.</p>

<h3>
<a name="hurl" class="anchor" href="#hurl"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>hurl</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/cdxr/haskell-hurl">hurl</a>
is a high-level interface to the Chipmunk physics library that is in
early development. It is based on the <code>Hipmunk</code> package, which is a more or
less straightforward (yet high-quality) binding to the C library.</p>

<p>The purpose of <code>hurl</code> is to provide a more idiomatic and expressive API than
<code>Hipmunk</code>. The most important goal in this regard is the use of functional
reactive programming to structure collision handling rather than using
callbacks.</p>

<h3>
<a name="drawing-2-d-graphics" class="anchor" href="#drawing-2-d-graphics"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>drawing 2-D graphics</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/cdxr/haskell-tooty">tooty</a>
(pronounced like 2-D) is a simple DSL for 2-dimensional drawing in
OpenGL. OpenGL is incredibly stateful, and often painful to use in Haskell.
<code>tooty</code> offers a functional-style API for drawing, but does not try to
encapsulate the details of OpenGL from the user.</p>

<p>An earlier experiment of mine, <code>draw</code>, was a library similar in spirit to
<code>tooty</code> but using SDL for graphics instead of OpenGL. In that library, drawing
computations were expressed in terms of a monad <code>Context c a</code> where <code>c</code>
constrained the capabilities of the drawing context. It was a fun concept
and I might return to it in the future, but next time using type-level
records to manage capabilities.</p>

<h3>
<a name="experiments" class="anchor" href="#experiments"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>experiments</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/cdxr/tree-writer">tree-writer</a> defines
Control.Monad.TreeWriter. It is a small specialized
version of the WriterT monad transformer used to construct rose trees.
It was a neat idea but I've found myself using <code>pipes</code> in all cases
where I might have used <code>tree-writer</code>.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/cdxr/weave">weave</a> defines the <code>Weave</code> type.
A <code>Weave c a</code> is isormorphic to <code>[Either c a]</code>, and can be used as a
traversable container of <code>a</code>s embedded in the monoid <code>c</code>.
For example, <code>Weave Text Image</code> represents a <code>Text</code> value with <code>Image</code>s
embedded throughout it. I created <code>weave</code> because it encapsulates a general
pattern that I recognized in several of my projects, but I'm still determining
its utility as a general abstraction.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/cdxr/regular-tile-haskell">regular-tile</a>
provides the typeclass <code>Tile</code>, a subclass of <code>Eq</code> and <code>Monoid</code>. It represents
a regular tile in the 2-D plane (there are three types: triangles, squares, and
hexagons). Expressing path-finding algorithms and other logic in terms of
the <code>Tile</code> typeclasses enable their use in libraries for boardgame-style computer
games that work in any of the three regular tilings.</p>

<h4>
<a name="command-line-interfaces" class="anchor" href="#command-line-interfaces"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>command line interfaces</h4>

<p>I am planning to develop a monadic framework for developing interactive
console interfaces. You would use the library to define a tree
of possible application states. The tree could be used to generate the
command line arguments for your program, and could also be used to generate an
"interactive mode" that assists a user who is unfamiliar with the program.</p>

<p>A few of my older projects were experiments working towards this goal:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/cdxr/terminal">terminal</a>
provides the mtl-style typeclass <code>MonadTerm</code>, which exposes the
functionality of a console interface. This is currently implemented in terms of
the <code>haskeline</code> package, but it could target other backends as well.</p>

<p><code>input</code> was a brief experiment with the same concepts as <code>terminal</code> but
expressed using operational monads.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/cdxr/save">save</a>
provides a type for managing application resources that should be saved
between uses of the application. It uses type-level programming to track
the modification of those resources and use that information implicitly for
control flow. I wrote it while I was going through a bit of an "over-engineering"
phase.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/cdxr/command">command</a> was a simple monadic parser for
structuring application-wide state changes in response to user input on the
command line. One goal of the project was to create a composable type
representing command line queries of the style (y/n). This was an old project
that I abandoned, but I might go back and rewrite it in terms of a standard
parser combinator library.</p>
